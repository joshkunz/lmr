# LMR: Little MapReduce (or Local MapReduce)

lmr is a tool for executing MapReduce-shaped tasks on a workstation. It's
similar to tools like `xargs` or `parallel` but provides a bit more structure
around job execution, failure handling, caching, and output management.

LMR is currently experimental, and may undergo significant API changes before
a proper v1 release. Depend on it at your own risk.
